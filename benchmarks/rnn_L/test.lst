 no it was n't black monday 
 but while the new york stock exchange did n't fall apart friday as the dow jones industrial average plunged N points most of it in the final hour it barely managed to stay this side of chaos 
 some circuit breakers installed after the october N crash failed their first test traders say unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures 
 the N stock specialist firms on the big board floor the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the N crash once again could n't handle the selling pressure 
 big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock traders say 
 heavy selling of standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures in chicago <unk> beat stocks downward 
 seven big board stocks ual amr bankamerica walt disney capital cities\/abc philip morris and pacific telesis group stopped trading and never resumed

 the equity market was <unk> 
 once again the specialists were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the new york stock exchange said christopher <unk> senior vice president at <unk> securities corp 
 <unk> james <unk> chairman of specialists henderson brothers inc. it is easy to say the specialist is n't doing his job 
 when the dollar is in a <unk> even central banks ca n't stop it 
 speculators are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market 
 many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early friday afternoon on a warm autumn day because the stock market was so quiet 
 <unk> trading accelerated to N million shares a record for the big board 
 at the end of the day N million shares were traded 
 the dow jones industrials closed at N 
 the dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the <unk> black monday crash that occurred oct. N N 
 in percentage terms however the dow 's dive was the <unk> ever and the sharpest since the market fell N or N N a week after black monday 
 the dow fell N N on black monday 
 shares of ual the parent of united airlines were extremely active all day friday reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ N billion buy-out of the airline by an <unk> group 
 wall street 's takeover-stock speculators or risk arbitragers had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and ual stock would rise 
 on the exchange floor as soon as ual stopped trading we <unk> for a panic said one top floor trader 
 several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news <unk> 
 for weeks the market had been nervous about takeovers after campeau corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers 
 and N minutes after the ual trading halt came news that the ual group could n't get financing for its bid 
 at this point the dow was down about N points 
 the market <unk> 
 arbitragers could n't dump their ual stock but they rid themselves of nearly every rumor stock they had 
 these stocks eventually reopened 
 but as panic spread speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as philip morris and international business machines to offset their losses 
 when trading was halted in philip morris the stock was trading at N down N N while ibm closed N N lower at N 
 most of the stock selling pressure came from wall street professionals including computer-guided program traders 
 traders said most of their major institutional investors on the other hand sat tight 
 now at N one of the market 's post-crash reforms took hold as the s&p N futures contract had plunged N points equivalent to around a <unk> drop in the dow industrials 
 under an agreement signed by the big board and the chicago mercantile exchange trading was temporarily halted in chicago 
 as a result the link between the futures and stock markets <unk> apart 
 without the <unk> of stock-index futures the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the big board 
 the futures halt was even <unk> by big board floor traders 
 it <unk> things up said one major specialist 
 this confusion effectively halted one form of program trading stock index arbitrage that closely links the futures and stock markets and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings 
 in a stock-index arbitrage sell program traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference 
 when the airline information came through it <unk> every model we had for the marketplace said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms 
 we did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do 
 but stocks kept falling 
 the dow industrials were down N points at N p.m. before the <unk> halt 
 meanwhile during the the s&p trading halt s&p futures sell orders began <unk> up while stocks in new york kept falling sharply 
 big board chairman john j. phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker worked well <unk> 
 i just think it 's <unk> at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things 
 under another post-crash system big board president richard <unk> mr. phelan was flying to <unk> as the market was falling was talking on an <unk> hot line to the other exchanges the securities and exchange commission and the federal reserve board 
 he <unk> out at a high-tech <unk> center on the floor of the big board where he could watch <unk> on prices and pending stock orders 
 buyers stepped in to the futures pit 
 but the <unk> of s&p futures sell orders weighed on the market and the link with stocks began to fray again 
 at about N the s&p market <unk> to still another limit of N points down and trading was locked again 
 futures traders say the s&p was <unk> that the dow could fall as much as N points 
 during this time small investors began ringing their brokers wondering whether another crash had begun 
 i have a <unk> that this particular decline today is something more <unk> about less 
 it would be my <unk> to advise clients not to sell to look for an opportunity to buy mr. ball told the brokers 
 at merrill lynch & co. the nation 's biggest brokerage firm a news release was prepared <unk> merrill lynch comments on market drop 
 the release cautioned that there are significant differences between the current environment and that of october N and that there are still attractive investment opportunities in the stock market 
 however jeffrey b. lane president of shearson lehman hutton inc. said that friday 's plunge is going to set back relations with customers because it <unk> the concern of volatility 
 and i think a lot of people will <unk> on program trading 
 it 's going to bring the debate right back to the <unk> 
 as the dow average ground to its final N loss friday the s&p pit stayed locked at its <unk> trading limit 
 jeffrey <unk> of program trader <unk> investment group said N s&p contracts were for sale on the close the equivalent of $ N million in stock 
 but there were no buyers 
 while friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning traders said 
 stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself 
 at those levels stocks are set up to be <unk> by index arbitragers who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall and simultaneously sell off stocks 
 but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today 
 the big board 's mr. <unk> said our <unk> performance was good 
 but the exchange will look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks 
 obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the <unk> obligations were n't met he said 
 but specialists complain privately that just as in the N crash the <unk> firms big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock stayed on the sidelines during friday 's <unk> 
 mr. phelan said it will take another day or two to analyze who was buying and selling friday

 ports of call inc. reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that were n't disclosed 
 the agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring 
 the company said a portion of the $ N million realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended <unk> operations 
 earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of boeing co. <unk> because of increasing maintenance costs 
 the $ N million bid includes the assumption of an estimated $ N million in secured liabilities on those properties according to those making the bid 
 the group is led by jay <unk> chief executive officer of <unk> investment corp. in <unk> and a. boyd simpson chief executive of the atlanta-based simpson organization inc 
 we want to build and hold 
 the consortium was put together by <unk> <unk> the london-based investment banking company that is a subsidiary of security pacific corp

 according to people familiar with the consortium the bid was <unk> project <unk> a reference to the film <unk> in which a <unk> played by actress <unk> <unk> is saved from a <unk> businessman by a police officer named john <unk> 
 eventually mr. simpson and mr. <unk> had a falling out over the direction of the company and mr. simpson said he resigned in N 
 these are n't mature assets but they have the potential to be so said mr. <unk> 
 managed properly and with a long-term outlook these can become investment-grade quality properties

 as small investors <unk> their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals cash 
 unlike the weekend before black monday the funds were n't <unk> with heavy withdrawal requests 
 and many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week 
 the boston firm said <unk> redemptions were running at less than one-third the level two years ago 
 as of yesterday afternoon the redemptions represented less than N N of the total cash position of about $ N billion of fidelity 's stock funds 
 two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around said c. bruce <unk> who runs fidelity investments ' $ N billion <unk> fund 
 this feels more like a <unk> deal 
 people are n't <unk> 
 the test may come today 
 friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act 
 some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices 
 stock fund redemptions during the N debacle did n't begin to <unk> until after the market opened on black monday 
 but fund managers say they 're ready 
 many have raised cash levels which act as a buffer against steep market declines 
 mario <unk> for instance holds cash positions well above N N in several of his funds 
 even peter lynch manager of fidelity 's $ N billion <unk> fund the nation 's largest stock fund built up cash to N N or $ N million 
 one reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in august and september 
 i 've let the money build up mr. lynch said who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes 
 not all funds have raised cash levels of course 
 as a group stock funds held N N of assets in cash as of august the latest figures available from the investment company institute 
 that was modestly higher than the N N and N N levels in august and september of N 
 also persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash 
 but a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around fund managers said 
 a major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since black monday 
 <unk> sales have rebounded in recent months but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half N levels 
 many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy 
 fidelity 's mr. lynch for his part snapped up southern co. shares friday after the stock got <unk> 
 if the market drops further today he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as bristol-myers and kellogg 
 if they <unk> stocks like that he said it presents an opportunity that is the kind of thing you dream about 
 major mutual-fund groups said phone calls were <unk> at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday 
 but most investors were seeking share prices and other information 
 trading volume was only modestly higher than normal 
 still fund groups are n't taking any chances 
 they hope to avoid the <unk> phone lines and other <unk> that <unk> some fund investors in october N 
 fidelity on saturday opened its N <unk> investor centers across the country 
 the centers normally are closed through the weekend 
 t. rowe price associates inc. increased its staff of phone representatives to handle investor requests 
 the <unk> group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money-market funds 
 but most investors seemed to be in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode said steven <unk> a vice president 
 in an unusual move several funds moved to calm investors with <unk> on their <unk> phone lines 
 we view friday 's market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors a recording at <unk> & co. funds said over the weekend 
 the <unk> group had a similar recording for investors 
 some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits 
 <unk> <unk> who runs shearson lehman hutton inc. 's $ N million sector analysis portfolio predicts the market will open down at least N points on technical factors and some panic selling 
 but she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than N N to N N from recent highs 
 this is not a major crash she said 
 nevertheless ms. <unk> said she was <unk> with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders 
 half of them are really scared and want to sell she said but i 'm trying to talk them out of it 
 she added if they all were bullish i 'd really be upset 
 the backdrop to friday 's slide was <unk> different from that of the october N crash fund managers argue 
 two years ago unlike today the dollar was weak interest rates were rising and the market was very <unk> they say 
 from the investors ' standpoint institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson by selling at the lows on black monday said stephen boesel manager of the $ N million t. rowe price growth and income fund 
 this time i do n't think we 'll get a panic reaction 
 newport corp. said it expects to report <unk> earnings of between N cents and N cents a share somewhat below analysts ' estimates of N cents to N cents 
 the maker of scientific instruments and laser parts said orders fell below expectations in recent months 
 a spokesman added that sales in the current quarter will about equal the <unk> quarter 's figure when newport reported net income of $ N million or N cents a share on $ N million in sales 
 <unk> from the strike by N machinists union members against boeing co. reached air carriers friday as america west airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the seattle jet maker 
 mr. <unk> said boeing told america west that the N it was supposed to get this thursday would n't be delivered until nov. N the day after the airline had been planning to <unk> service at houston with four daily flights including three <unk> to phoenix and one <unk> to las vegas 
 now those routes are n't expected to begin until jan 
 boeing is also supposed to send to america west another N <unk> aircraft as well as a N by year 's end 
 those too are almost certain to arrive late 
 nevertheless the company 's reaction <unk> the <unk> effect that a huge manufacturer such as boeing can have on other parts of the economy 
 it also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company 
 i just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged <unk> tom baker president of machinists ' district N said in an interview yesterday 
 i do n't think their customers would like it very much 
 america west though is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be 
 indeed a random check friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations 
 a spokesman for amr corp. said boeing has assured american airlines it will deliver a N on time later this month 
 american is preparing to take delivery of another N in early december and N more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable 
 in seattle a boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike 
 meanwhile supervisors and <unk> employees have been trying to finish some N aircraft mostly N and N jumbo jets at the company 's <unk> wash. plant that were all but completed before the <unk> 
 as of friday four had been delivered and a fifth plane a N was supposed to be <unk> out over the weekend to air china 
 no date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table 
 we want to make sure they know what they want before they come back said doug hammond the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began 
 the investment community for one has been anticipating a <unk> resolution 
 though boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market friday it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders 
 the market has taken two views that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very <unk> for boeing in the long term said howard <unk> an analyst at <unk> j. lawrence inc 
 boeing 's shares fell $ N friday to close at $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 but mr. baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month <unk> that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week 
 still he said it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer 
 i would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything 
 last week boeing chairman frank <unk> sent striking workers a letter saying that to my knowledge boeing 's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major u.s. industrial firm in recent history 
 but mr. baker called the letter and the company 's offer of a N N wage increase over the life of the pact plus bonuses very weak 
 he added that the company <unk> the union 's resolve and the workers ' <unk> with being forced to work many hours overtime 
 the union is continuing to work through its expired contract however 
 it had planned a strike vote for next sunday but that has been pushed back indefinitely 
 the accord expired yesterday 
 and boeing on friday said it received an order from <unk> <unk> for four model N <unk> <unk> valued at a total of about $ N million 
 the planes long range versions of the <unk> <unk> will be delivered with <unk> & <unk> <unk> engines 
 <unk> & <unk> is a unit of united technologies inc

 our long suit is our proven ability to operate power plants he said

 <unk> & broad a home building company declined to identify the institutional investors 
 the land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received <unk> and other approvals required for development and part of <unk> & broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals 
 the partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development but in return it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices which can result in sizable savings said bruce <unk> president and chief executive officer of <unk> & broad 
 there are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash 
 typically developers option property and then once they get the administrative approvals they buy it said mr. <unk> adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind 
 we usually operate in that conservative manner 
 by setting up the joint venture <unk> & broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land while avoiding the negative <unk> to its own balance sheet mr. <unk> said 
 the company is putting up only N N of the capital although it is responsible for providing management planning and processing services to the joint venture

 thursday 's report on the september consumer price index is expected to rise although not as sharply as the N N gain reported friday in the producer price index

 overall sales of all <unk> vehicles fell N N from a year ago 
 without gm overall sales for the other u.s. <unk> were roughly flat with N results

 cadillac posted a N N increase despite new competition from lexus the <unk> luxury-car division of toyota motor corp 
 lexus sales were n't available the cars are imported and toyota reports their sales only at <unk> 
 the sales drop for the no. N car maker may have been caused in part by the end in september of dealer incentives that gm offered in addition to consumer rebates and <unk> financing a company spokesman said

 it was n't so long ago that a radio network funded by the u.s. congress and originally by the central intelligence agency was accused by officials here of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 now the network has opened a news bureau in the <unk> capital

 i think this is a victory for the radio says <unk> de <unk> a <unk> former <unk> <unk> who works in the <unk> west germany headquarters as deputy director of the <unk> service 
 in fact the network hopes to set up offices in warsaw and anywhere else in the east bloc that will have it 
 but the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are <unk> the network 's life in more ways than one 
 in fact radio free europe is in danger of suffering from its success 
 while the network currently can operate freely in <unk> so can others 
 in addition competition for <unk> is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled 
 they have a lot to do these days to compete with <unk> radio says andrew <unk> a <unk> student at the technical university in <unk> 
 the <unk> radio reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here

 proposals for <unk> national service like <unk> <unk> up from time to time depress the resistance of the body <unk> run their course and seem to disappear only to <unk> and <unk> public life <unk> 
 the disease <unk> comes to mind of course not as an <unk> on the advocates of national service 
 rather it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing <unk> of a <unk> idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s along with <unk> 
 it is back with us again in the form of legislation to pay <unk> under a national and community service act a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall 
 why does the <unk> virus keep coming back 
 perhaps it is because <unk> <unk> <unk> both military experience and the social <unk> 
 if only we could get america 's <unk> youth into at least a <unk> uniform we might be able to teach <unk> again and revive the spirit of giving 
 a quarter of a century ago national service was <unk> as a way of <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the draft by of all things expanding the draft 
 those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many <unk> backers despite their protests that present plans contain no <unk> 
 choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to <unk> national service as much as the draft 
 but the virus was kept alive in <unk> departments until a couple of years ago when it again was let loose 
 this time it attempted to <unk> two connected problems the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans 
 why not keep and even expand the loans and grants the advocates <unk> but require some form of service from each <unk> 
 military service moreover could be a <unk> option 
 the democratic leadership council a <unk> group <unk> the plan surely thought it might help the party to attract support especially among college students and their parents 
 a provision allowing grants to be applied to <unk> purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of <unk> 
 the <unk> plan <unk> <unk> <unk> trees <unk> <unk> <unk> children and <unk> <unk> for $ N a week tax free plus medical care 
 with a tax-free $ N <unk> payment at the end of each year the <unk> would be making a wage comparable to $ N a year 
 mind you most of the <unk> would be <unk> N to <unk> some not even high school graduates and many saving money by living at home 
 they would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families 
 as it happened political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system so the <unk> <unk> decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of give in order to get 
 opposition to national service from the pentagon which wants to protect its own <unk> process also led to the <unk> option being dropped 
 what better place to turn than sen. edward kennedy 's labor committee that great <unk> of government <unk> where many a <unk> pot of <unk> is kept on the back <unk> until it can be brought forward and presented as <unk> <unk> 
 before the <unk> is printed the house may add more <unk> also changing the initial price now posted at some $ N million 
 it is widely known that too many <unk> <unk> the <unk> but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the <unk> especially if they are senators 
 the omnibus bill coming out of congress may be <unk> <unk> but the <unk> chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the <unk> very hard 
 the <unk> of <unk> is in the air 
 is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance 
 on the contrary it is as robust as ever 
 according to the <unk> poll american adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen N N adjusted for inflation 
 even if government does see various <unk> needs national service is not the way to meet them 
 if we want to support students we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more <unk> based on something called <unk> rather than on the government 's idea of service 
 or we might provide a tax credit for working students 
 what we do not need to do is start a war and then try to justify it by creating a <unk> bill 
 to the extent we lack manpower to staff <unk> jobs in hospitals for example we should raise pay pursue <unk> technology or allow more legal <unk> rather than <unk> high school graduates as short-term workers and cause <unk> among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs 
 will national service in the current highly <unk> and <unk> form <unk> enough appeal to get adopted 
 not necessarily 
 polls show wide <unk> support for some vague concept of service but the bill now under discussion lacks any <unk> public backing 
 nonetheless senate democrats are organizing a roll of supporting associations <unk> and <unk> some of which may hope to receive the paid <unk> 
 however even this <unk> plan could become <unk> if the white house gives in to congressional democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in <unk> federal funds for volunteer projects 
 there 's no need for such concessions 
 the omnibus can be defeated the virus controlled and real service protected 
 national service the <unk> idea still wo n't go away then of course but the millions of <unk> youth performing works of civic content will be <unk> only in the <unk> of their <unk>

 the debate over national service has begun again 
 after a decade in which more than N <unk> established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a <unk> to high school <unk> the focus has shifted to washington 
 at least N bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in congress this spring 
 one <unk> by sen. sam <unk> d. <unk> and rep. dave <unk> d. okla. would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served 
 it might well win senate passage 
 president bush has outlined his own youth entering service yes plan though its details remain to be specified 
 what is one to think of all this 
 doctrine and special interests govern some responses 
 people eager to have youth pay their <unk> to society favor service proposals <unk> mandatory ones 
 so do those who seek a <unk> concept of <unk> a concept imposing stern obligations as well as <unk> rights 
 to <unk> mandatory service is an <unk> and voluntary systems are <unk> uses of tax money 
 <unk> of the market question the value of the work national service would perform 
 if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth its cost 
 elements of the left are also <unk> opposed they see service as a cover for the draft or fear the <unk> of youth or want to see rights <unk> not obligations 
 but what about those of us whose views are not <unk> by formula or <unk> 
 how should we think about national service 
 let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion national service has no agreed meaning 
 would service be voluntary or <unk> 
 short or long 
 <unk> or full-time 
 paid or unpaid 
 would participants live at home and work nearby or live in <unk> and work on public <unk> 
 what kinds of work would they do 
 what does national mean 
 would the program be run by the federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations 
 and who would serve 
 only males as with the draft or both <unk> 
 many or few 
 those are not <unk> questions and the label national service answers none of them 
 then how should we think about national service 
 as a starting point here are five <unk> N consider the <unk> not the name 
 they will differ in crucial ways 
 N service should be service 
 as commonly understood service implies sacrifice 
 it involves accepting risk or giving up income or deferring a career 
 it follows that proposals like <unk> whose benefits to <unk> are worth some $ N a year do not qualify 
 but the earnings exceed by N N the average income of young high school graduates with full-time jobs 
 why call that service 
 <unk> service is unconstitutional 
 it is also <unk> and <unk> 
 who will throw several hundred thousand <unk> in jail each year 
 but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior 
 N good programs are not cheap 
 enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done <unk> forest fires fought housing <unk> students <unk> <unk> centers <unk> 
 there is important work to be done and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even <unk> who start with few skills can do much of it well but not <unk> 
 good service programs require <unk> <unk> training and supervision all of high quality 
 they involve <unk> to participants 
 full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision they are particularly expensive more per participant than a year at stanford or yale 
 <unk> programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some $ N a year 
 are they worth that 
 <unk> suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are counted 
 but the calculations are <unk> 
 N <unk> youth are a special concern 
 are such expenditures <unk> then 
 yes if targeted 
 they can volunteer at any of thousands of <unk> institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers 
 <unk> youth do n't have those opportunities 
 they are not <unk> in high school or college 
 they are unlikely to be employed 
 but many of them can be quite <unk> <unk> by productive and disciplined service 
 some wo n't accept the discipline others drop out for other reasons 
 but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed 
 learning skills producing something <unk> feeling useful they are no longer dependent others now depend on them 
 strictly speaking these youth are not performing service 
 they are giving up no income deferring no careers <unk> no risk 
 but they believe themselves to be serving and they begin to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives to think of the future 
 that is a service to the nation 
 it is what federal support should try hardest to achieve 
 mr. <unk> a carter administration budget official heads his own washington-based strategic planning firm

 government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a monday market <unk> but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet 
 and at the treasury secretary nicholas brady talked with friends and associates on wall street while assistant secretary david mullins carefully <unk> data on the friday market plunge 
 but the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters 
 in addition officials at the fed and in the bush administration decided that avoiding <unk> actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout 
 the disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis said one government official insisting on <unk> 
 the fed 's efforts at <unk> were partly <unk> sunday morning when both the new york times and the washington post carried stories <unk> a senior fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system monday morning 
 nevertheless fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate <unk> of the central bank 's game plan 
 the fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions 
 i 'm sure they 'll do what 's right what 's prudent what 's <unk> he said 
 at the treasury secretary brady issued a statement <unk> the stock market 's drop 
 today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy he said 
 the economy remains <unk> and the outlook is for continued moderate growth 
 but administration officials conceded that friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week 
 one possibility is that this is a surgical setback reasonably limited in its <unk> and not a major problem said one senior administration official who also asked that he not be named 
 the other is that we see another major disaster like two years ago 
 i think that 's less likely 
 the action was expected to begin with the opening of the new zealand foreign exchange markets at N p.m. est when stocks there plunged and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in tokyo and through early this morning in europe 
 both the treasury and the fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments 
 in tokyo share prices dropped sharply by N N in early monday morning trading 
 after the initial slide the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower 
 in the bush administration the lead is being taken by treasury secretary brady undersecretary robert <unk> and assistant secretary mullins 
 the three men worked together on the so-called brady commission headed by mr. brady which was established after the N crash to examine the market 's collapse 
 as a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets and financial market crises 
 mr. brady was at the white house friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began 
 administration officials say president bush was <unk> throughout friday afternoon and evening even after leaving for camp david 
 he had frequent telephone <unk> with mr. brady and michael <unk> chairman of the counsel of economic advisers 
 government officials tried throughout the weekend to <unk> a <unk> appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic 
 treasury undersecretary david mulford for instance was at a meeting of the business council in hot springs va. when the stock market fell and remained there through the following day 
 he flew to dallas on oct. N when the market plummeted N points but then turned around the next morning and returned to washington without delivering his speech

 resist the urge to call your broker and sell all your stocks 
 that 's the advice of most investment professionals after friday 's 190-point drop in the dow jones industrial average 
 no one can say for sure what will happen today 
 and investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months 
 but they 're nearly <unk> on one point do n't sell into a panic 
 investors who sold everything after the crash of N lived to regret it 
 panic selling also was <unk> during other big declines in the past 
 the crash of N was followed by a substantial recovery before the great depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began 
 there has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash says stephen b. <unk> chief investment officer of chicago-based kemper financial services inc 
 but most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat 
 even for people who expect a bear market in coming months and a sizable number of money managers and market <unk> do the advice is wait for the market to bounce back and sell shares gradually during rallies 
 on the one hand mr. front says it would be <unk> to sell into a classic panic 
 on the other hand it 's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy 
 this is all <unk> right now and when <unk> starts to run it can run further than anyone anticipates he said 
 roger <unk> professor of finance at yale university and head of the market information firm <unk> associates inc. says my real advice would be to just ride through it 
 generally it is n't <unk> to be in and out of the stock market 
 but he also thinks it is a good week to consider buying 
 john <unk> former president of the los angeles chapter of the national association of investors corp. an organization of investment clubs and individual investors says his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of N and see no reason to sell now 
 we 're dedicated long-term investors not traders he says 
 we understand <unk> and euphoria 
 and we hope to take advantage of <unk> and buy stocks when they plunge 
 one camp of investment pros sees what happened friday as an opportunity 
 over the next days and weeks they say investors should look for stocks to buy 
 friday 's action was an old-fashioned panic says alfred goldman director of technical market analysis for a.g. edwards & sons in st. louis 
 his advice you ought to be there with a basket catching them 
 james craig portfolio manager for the <unk> <unk> fund which has one of the industry 's better track records started his buying during friday 's plunge 
 stocks such as <unk> foods corp. <unk> stores inc. american international group inc. and federal national mortgage association became such bargains that he could n't resist them he says 
 and mr. craig expects to pick up more shares today 
 it will be chaotic at first but i would not be buying if i thought we were headed for real trouble he says 
 he argues that stocks are reasonably valued now and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of N 
 his firm favors selected computer drug and <unk> stocks 
 other investment pros are more pessimistic 
 they say investors should sell stocks but not necessarily right away 
 many of them stress that the selling can be orderly gradual and done when stock prices are <unk> 
 on thursday william <unk> a seattle money manager used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline 
 he thinks the underlying inflation rate is around N N to N N far higher than most people <unk> 
 in the pension accounts he manages mr. <unk> has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks partly as an inflation hedge 
 he thinks government officials are <unk> to let a recession start when government corporate and personal debt levels are so high 
 so he thinks the government will <unk> on the side of <unk> inflation 
 as a result mr. <unk> says i think the ball game 's over and investors are about to face a bear market 
 he says the oct. N employment report showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector is a warning sign to investors 
 one strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy put options either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index 
 a put option gives its holder the right but not the obligation to sell a stock or stock index for a specified price the strike price until the option expires 
 whether this insurance is <unk> depends on the cost of an option 
 the cost or premium tends to get fat in times of crisis 
 thus buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk 
 the prices of puts generally did n't soar friday 
 for example the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on eli lilly & co. moved up from N N at thursday 's close to only N N at friday 's close even though the shares dropped more than $ N 
 but <unk> prices may <unk> when trading <unk> today 
 it 's hard to <unk> about a reasonable price for puts 
 but investors should keep in mind before paying too much that the average annual return for stock holdings long-term is N N to N N a year a return of N N is considered <unk> 
 paying say N N for insurance against losses takes a deep <unk> out of the return

 <unk> banker commercial group said it sold $ N million of common stock to its employees at $ N a share giving them a total stake of more than N N in the commercial real estate brokerage firm 
 though the offering did n't sell out james j. <unk> chairman and chief executive officer said we 're pretty proud of the employees ' response 
 he noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan where a company usually <unk> money from third party lenders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time here employees had to <unk> out their own cash for the stock 
 they came up with their own money instead of borrowed money mr. <unk> said 
 it 's totally different 
 he said the offering was designed to create long-term incentives for employees 
 we 're in a service business and in that context it 's vital to have your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success 
 the brokerage firm wo n't pay a dividend on the stock 
 employees have the right to trade stock among themselves and the company will establish an internal clearing house for these transactions 
 they may also eventually sell the shares to third parties but the outside investors who own the remaining N N of <unk> banker have the right to first refusal 
 <unk> banker also named three outside director <unk> for its N member board 
 the <unk> are gary wilson chief financial officer of walt disney co. james montgomery chief executive officer of great western financial corp. and peter <unk> former commissioner of baseball and now a private investor 
 the first major event this morning in u.s. stock and futures trading may be a <unk> at the chicago mercantile exchange 
 under a reform arising from the N crash trading in the merc 's stock-index futures will break for N minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from friday 's close a move equal to N points on the dow jones industrial average 
 the aim of the <unk> would be to ease the opening of the new york stock exchange which would be <unk> by such a volatile move on the merc 
 that <unk> <unk> is just one of a number of <unk> adopted after the N crash 
 the big board also added computer capacity to handle huge <unk> in trading volume 
 but the major circuit breakers have yet to be <unk> 
 a deeper market plunge today could give them their first test 
 a further slide also would <unk> debate over a host of other more sweeping changes proposed but not implemented after the last crash 
 most notably several of the regulatory steps recommended by the brady task force which <unk> the N crash would be revived especially because that group 's chairman is now the treasury secretary 
 the most controversial of the brady recommendations involved establishing a single <unk> regulator to handle crucial <unk> questions such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets 
 but for the moment attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended 
 big board and merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the merc 's standard & poor 's N contract as well as <unk> communications among exchanges 
 those <unk> from N p.m. to N p.m. <unk> and from N p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels 
 during the first halt after the s&p index had fallen N points the big board 's <unk> computer program automatically was triggered 
 that system is designed to separate <unk> program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks 
 one merc broker compared the action in the s&p pit during the two <unk> to a fire at a <unk> school 
 you do n't want the fire but you know what to do said howard <unk> an independent floor broker and a merc governor 
 there was no panic 
 the system worked the way we devised it to work 
 after <unk> for about N minutes the s&p index tumbled to its <unk> limit and the second freeze went into effect 
 traders then spent the last half-hour watching to see if the dow would drop N points mr. <unk> added referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour

 only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented 
 the reagan white house held the brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel the working group on the financial markets to review its analysis and those of other crash studies

 stunned they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades 
 this <unk> is far from over he says 
 junk 's collapse helped <unk> the <unk> selling of stocks that produced the <unk> one-day dive in the dow jones industrial average since the oct. N N crash 
 simultaneously it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the u.s. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the <unk> securities they could find 
 but an <unk> <unk> <unk> the junk market friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite no active trading says john <unk> an economist at moody 's investors service inc

 when you get panic in one market you get flight to quality in the other said maria ramirez money market economist at drexel burnham lambert inc 
 nevertheless the problems of the junk market could prompt the federal reserve to ease credit in the months ahead 
 this marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook says william sullivan director of money market research at dean witter reynolds inc. new york 
 any sustained <unk> could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities 
 it was <unk> <unk> 
 he adds the junk market has <unk> some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets <unk> that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk 
 i do n't believe that 's the case but i believe that people are running scared 
 there is a flight to quality and the quality is not in equities and not in junk it 's in treasurys 
 even as trading in high-yield issues <unk> up over the past month corporations sold more than $ N billion of new junk bonds 
 first boston estimates that in november and december alone junk bond investors will receive $ N billion of coupon interest payments

 michael <unk> director of fixed-income research at kemper financial services says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer contributing to the slide in prices 
 last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals he says 
 this year at best it 's in one in every five or six 
 and our credit standards have n't changed one <unk> 
 for the moment investors seem more <unk> with the bad junk than the good junk 
 the market has been weak since the announcement of the campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by olympia & york says mr. <unk> of merrill lynch 
 that really affected the market in that people started to ask what else is in trouble 
 well before campeau though there were signs that the junk market was <unk> through one of its worst years ever 
 despite the relatively strong economy junk bond prices did nothing except go down <unk> by a seemingly endless trail of bad news

 what we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying <unk> compound interest 
 businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings 
 what we 're seeing now is the <unk> <unk> of asset values to a future when <unk> debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy 
 friday 's market activity 
 prices of treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a <unk> stock market 
 the yield on the benchmark fell to N N the lowest since march N N according to technical data global markets group 
 the flight to quality began late in the day and followed a <unk> fall in the stock market

 roger <unk> contributed to this article 
 friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come <unk> the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their N october crash and <unk> have been put in place to keep markets more orderly 
 still the lesson is about the same on friday the 13th the market was spooked by washington 
 the consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the ual takeover and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the ual trading halt 
 still the consensus seems almost as wide that one <unk> bid is no reason to write down the value of all u.s. business 
 this <unk> leads us to another piece of news moving on the dow jones <unk> shortly before the downturn the success of senate democrats in <unk> the capital gains tax cut 
 the real value of all shares after all is directly <unk> by the tax on any profits all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not ordinary income 
 and market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the house last month 
 an hour before friday 's plunge that provision was stripped from the tax bill leaving it with $ N billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut 
 it would be a good thing if congress started to decide issues <unk> on their individual merits without <unk> 
 for one thing no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an <unk> vote 
 since senate leaders have so far <unk> it up with procedural <unk> promises of a cleaner bill are suspect 
 especially so since president bush has been weakened by the panama <unk> 
 to the extent that the ual troubles contributed to the plunge they are another instance of washington 's <unk> fingers 
 as the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course at some point the market will start to reject them 
 worse congress has started to jump on the skinner <unk> 
 james <unk> the minnesota democrat who chairs the public works and transportation committee 's aviation subcommittee has put an <unk> takeover bill on <unk> speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the american and united air lines bids 
 it would give mr. skinner up to N days to review any bid for N N or more of the voting stock of any u.s. carrier with revenues of $ N billion or more 
 so the ual deal has problems and the market loses N points 
 <unk> mr. secretary and mr. congressman 
 in the N crash remember the market was shaken by a danny <unk> proposal to tax takeovers out of <unk> 
 even more important in our view was the treasury 's threat to <unk> the dollar 
 the treasury is doing the same thing today <unk> the dollar is not under <unk> pressure 
 also traders are in better shape today than in N to survive selling <unk> 
 they are better capitalized 
 they are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape <unk> and clearing and settlement delays 
 the fed promises any needed liquidity 
 the big board 's <unk> with the chicago board of trade has improved it will be interesting to learn if circuit breakers prove to be a good idea 
 in any event some traders see stocks as <unk> today unlike N 
 there is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be <unk> by a little <unk> and common sense in washington 
 but on the bearish side that may be too much to expect 
 first chicago corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $ N million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans 
 the addition on top of two big N additions to <unk> reserves brings the reserve to a level equaling N N of <unk> and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations 
 first chicago since N has reduced its loans to such nations to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 despite this loss first chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital 
 during the quarter the company realized a pretax gain of $ N million from the sale of its first chicago investment <unk> unit 
 combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped N N against last year 's third quarter to $ N million from $ N million

 greece 's second <unk> of general elections this year is slated for nov. N 
 in the <unk> round of voting <unk> gave no clear mandate to any single political party 
 the ad interim coalition government that emerged from <unk> <unk> was in <unk> little more than the <unk> <unk> of ideological <unk> on one side the <unk> new democracy party headed by <unk> <unk> 
 on the other the so-called coalition of the left and progress a <unk> and rather deceptive title for a merger of the <unk> communist party of greece and its <unk> <unk> the <unk> left 
 the <unk> goal was a <unk> of government corruption <unk> at all levels but the main marks were mr. <unk> and his <unk> associates 
 in point of fact this <unk> was overdue by decades 
 when reduced to <unk> status in <unk> <unk> <unk> however the notion <unk> into a promised assault with targets primarily for political gains not justice 
 with regard to greece 's <unk> <unk> scandal mr. <unk> 's principal <unk> remains george <unk> former owner of the bank of <unk> and <unk> <unk> now <unk> in a jail cell in <unk> mass. from where he is fighting <unk> proceedings that would return him to greece 
 mr. <unk> 's credibility is at best <unk> 
 he has ample motive to shift the blame and his testimony has also been found less than <unk> on numerous points 
 nevertheless the new democracy and communist parties herald his <unk> as proof of <unk> <unk> 
 among <unk> questions are whether mr. <unk> received $ N million of stolen bank of <unk> funds and an additional $ N in <unk> as contended whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ N million in mr. <unk> 's bank and then <unk> off the interest and what <unk> 's cut was from the $ N million mr. <unk> <unk> 
 two former ministers were so heavily <unk> in the <unk> affair that <unk> members of parliament voted to refer them to the special court 
 but <unk> parliamentary probe was the case of millions of <unk> mr. <unk> <unk> into new democracy <unk> 
 in the end the investigation produced only <unk> evidence and indications that point to <unk> not <unk> proof 
 on another issue <unk> were told how their national intelligence agency the <unk> regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures including key opposition politicians journalists and <unk> cabinet members 
 despite convincing arguments it was never established that mr. <unk> personally ordered or directed the <unk> 
 the central weakness of the scandals debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and <unk> 
 so it seems that mr. <unk> and his communist <unk> may have <unk> served mr. <unk> a moral victory on a <unk> <unk> whether guilty or not can now <unk> the <unk> <unk> the whole affair as a <unk> hunt at mr. <unk> 's expense 
 first came his predictable <unk> he charged the coalition of the left and progress had sold out its leftist <unk> by <unk> in a <unk> plot aimed at <unk> <unk> and <unk> the course of socialism in greece 
 then to <unk> his credibility with the left he <unk> some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the <unk> <unk> 
 next he continued to court the communists many of whom feel <unk> by the <unk> coalition 's birth by bringing into <unk> a <unk> communist party candidate 
 for balance and in hopes of gaining some <unk> <unk> votes he managed to attract a former new democracy party representative and known political enemy of mr. <unk> 
 thus <unk> heads for the polls not only with diminished <unk> but also with <unk> of approval from representatives of its <unk> <unk> 
 crucial as these elections are for greece pressing issues of state are getting lost in the <unk> 
 the country 's future nato participation remains <unk> for instance 
 greece also must <unk> major pieces of legislation in preparation for the N targets of heightened common market cooperation 
 greece 's <unk> relations with the u.s. need attention soon as well 
 for one the current accord concerning u.s. military bases in greece <unk> in may N 
 negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the june elections but the <unk> is running 
 the <unk> courts have decided in favor of <unk> in the <unk> case but the matter <unk> final approval from greece 's next justice minister 
 the <unk> seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a <unk> test of whether greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism 
 that <unk> could win the elections outright is <unk> the <unk> press previously eager to palm off <unk> 's line has turned on mr. <unk> with a <unk> <unk> 
 yet the possibility of another <unk> government is all too real 
 if mr. <unk> becomes the major opposition leader he could <unk> a <unk> coalition 
 also he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in march 
 as for mr. <unk> 
 he 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage

 the ruling stems from a N suit filed by shareholders of apple computer inc. claiming that company officials <unk> investors about the expected success of the <unk> computer introduced in N 
 lawyers specializing in shareholder suits said they are concerned that use of the press defense by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling

 the suit claimed apple 's stock climbed to a high of $ N a share on the basis of the company 's optimistic forecasts 
 the shareholders claimed more than $ N million in losses 
 in N the san francisco district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently <unk> the company 's statements by <unk> consumers to <unk> 's problems

 however it gave the shareholders the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that <unk> to <unk> 's disk drive known as <unk> 
 the court ruled that the news media did n't reveal <unk> 's problems at the time

 <unk> <unk> in los angeles contributed to this column 
 of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease 
 to take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment however the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms 
 it must also evaluate the real-estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective 
 specifically it must understand how real-estate markets <unk> to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities 
 when a regional economy <unk> cold the local real-estate market gets <unk> 
 this was seen in the late 1960s in los angeles and the mid-1970s in new york 
 but the reverse is also true when a region 's economy <unk> from a slowdown these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy 
 why do local real-estate markets <unk> to regional economic cycles 
 because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth 
 metropolitan detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment 
 area employment dropped by N N from its N peak and retail sales were down N N 
 however the real-estate market was hurt even more 
 for example residential building permits in the trough year of N were off N N from the N peak level 
 once metropolitan detroit 's economy rallied in the mid-1980s real estate rebounded 
 building permits for example soared a staggering N N between N and the peak year of N 
 where <unk> corporations and professional firms are now asking are today 's opportunities 
 of course some observers have touted houston and denver for the past five years as a <unk> play 
 but now appears to be the time to act 
 metropolitan houston 's economy did drop and then <unk> in the years after its N peak 
 in the mid-1980s employment was down as much as N N from the N peak and retail sales were off N N 
 office construction dropped N N 
 the vacancy rate soared more than N N in nearly every product category and more than N N of office space was vacant 
 to some observers the empty office buildings of houston 's <unk> <unk> were <unk> of a very troubled economy 
 as usual the real-estate market had <unk> 
 actually the region 's economy retained a firm foundation 
 metropolitan houston 's population has held steady over the past six years 
 and personal income after <unk> in the mid-1980s has returned to its N level in real dollar terms 
 today metropolitan houston 's real-estate market is poised for a significant turnaround 
 this growth puts houston in the top five <unk> areas in the nation last year 
 and forecasts project a N N to N N growth rate in jobs over the next few years nearly twice the national average 
 denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has <unk> to the region 's economic trends although denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as houston 
 by some measures metropolitan denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years 
 its population has continued to increase since N the peak year of the economic cycle 
 employment is now N N higher than in N 
 buying income in real dollars actually increased N N between N and N the most recent year available 
 the rates of increase however are less than the rapid growth of the boom years and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy 
 in a <unk> <unk> therefore the region 's real-estate market all but collapsed in recent years 
 housing building permits are down more than N N from their N <unk> 
 when denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster such a recovery could occur as early as next year business and consumer confidence will return and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will <unk> the general economic rebound 
 what real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as houston 's or denver 's 
 generally overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as washington new york and los angeles 
 vacancy rates in the N N to N N range today may easily rise to the low to <unk> N range in a couple of years 
 under these conditions even a <unk> out of economic growth catching cold in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the <unk> industry <unk> <unk> 
 those looking for real-estate bargains in <unk> metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term three-year lease and wait for the bargains ahead

 the administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by chief justice william <unk> last july when the high court upheld missouri 's abortion restrictions 
 under that standard which <unk> the votes of only three of the nine justices a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a reasonable <unk> for adopting it 
 that is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the supreme court 's test since N which requires a state to have a compelling reason for restricting abortion 
 on the provisions of the minnesota law the bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows <unk> to go to court for a judge 's permission instead 
 the case <unk> vs. minnesota will be argued nov. N 
 aluminum co. of america hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas said net income for the third quarter dropped N N to $ N million or $ N a share 
 the nation 's no. N aluminum maker earned $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 analysts who were expecting <unk> to post around $ N to $ N a share were surprised at the lackluster third-quarter results 
 it 's disappointing said william <unk> an analyst with smith barney harris upham & co 
 much of the earnings decline was led by <unk> rate adjustments which affected the bottom line by $ N million or N cents a share compared with $ N million or four cents a share the previous year 
 lower prices for aluminum <unk> and certain <unk> products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings the company said 
 in addition costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant <unk> for modernization work the company said 
 excluding the higher tax rate which rose two percentage points to N N and the negative exchange rate adjustment the company would have met analysts ' expectations said r. wayne <unk> an analyst with goldman sachs & co 
 noting that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry 's <unk> mr. <unk> added the third quarter is never a bang up period for them anyway 
 nevertheless the company said shipments were up slightly to N metric tons from N <unk> the impact of the unexpected earning decline 
 the results were announced after the stock market closed 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading friday <unk> closed at $ N a share down $ N in a sharply lower market 
 for N years federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing parts of the television business 
 and for six years nbc abc and cbs have negotiated with hollywood studios in a <unk> attempt to change that 
 but with foreign companies <unk> up u.s. movie studios the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever 
 even network executives however admit privately that victory either in congress or in talks with the studios is highly doubtful any time soon 
 and so the networks also are pushing for new ways to <unk> the <unk> provisions known formally as the financial interest and <unk> rules 
 even if that deal is n't revived nbc hopes to find another 
 our doors are open an nbc spokesman says 
 nbc may yet find a way to take a passive minority interest in a <unk> without violating the rules 
 and any nbc effort could prompt cbs inc. and abc 's parent capital cities\/abc inc. to look for ways of <unk> the <unk> regulations 
 but the networks ' push may only <unk> an increasingly bitter <unk> between them and hollywood studios 
 both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing <unk> restraints 
 few people <unk> to the talks expect the studios to <unk> 
 studios are <unk> to get shows in prime-time <unk> and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative <unk> sales he contends 
 and that 's why the rules for the most part must stay in place he says 
 studio executives in on the talks including officials at paramount communications inc. <unk> entertainment inc. warner communications inc. and mca inc. declined to be interviewed 
 but mr. <unk> who represents the studios asserts the whole production industry to a man is on the side of preserving the rules 
 such <unk> leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will <unk> 
 they do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate says one network executive 
 and there 's no indication that washington is prepared to address the rules 
 that 's the problem is n't it 
 indeed it is 
 congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess urging the studios and the networks which license rights to air shows made by the studios to work out their own compromise 
 but recent developments have made the networks and nbc president robert wright in particular ever more <unk> that the networks must be <unk> to survive 
 the latest <unk> sony corp. 's plan to acquire columbia pictures entertainment inc. for $ N billion and to buy independent producer guber peters entertainment co. for $ N million 
 in his article mr. <unk> who was in europe last week and unavailable complained that the <unk> restraints in <unk> rules have contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-u.s. enterprises 
 the big three 's <unk> for deregulation began <unk> in the summer when the former time inc. went ahead with plans to acquire warner 
 nbc 's mr. wright led the way in <unk> the networks ' inability to match a <unk> combination 
 he spoke up again when the sony bid for columbia was announced 
 it 's never really been tested says william <unk> iii who as a top cbs executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted 
 he now runs policy communications in washington consulting to media companies 
 <unk> rules do n't <unk> block a network from buying a passive small stake in a company that profits from the <unk> <unk> networks ca n't enjoy 
 if the transaction raised objections the studio 's <unk> operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake 
 but such <unk> would still block the networks from <unk> a big chunk of the <unk> of <unk> 
 instead abc will have to sell off the rights for a one-time fee 
 six years ago they were <unk> close 
 the <unk> federal communications commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules 
 various evidence including a <unk> institution study of some N series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s showed the networks did n't <unk> <unk> control over the studios as had been alleged 
 but just eight days before the rules were to die former president ronald reagan a one-time actor intervened on behalf of hollywood 
 the networks and studios have <unk> ever since 
 in congress the issue <unk> it 's about money not program quality and hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue 
 but he said mr. markey hopes this <unk> the networks and studios to work it out on their own 
 recognition equipment inc. said it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the u.s. postal service 
 the government sued the company in april seeking $ N and other unspecified damages related to an alleged <unk> scheme 
 the suit named the company former chief executive officer william g. moore jr. former vice president robert w. <unk> and five defendants who were n't part of the company 
 the suit charged the defendants with causing peter e. <unk> an <unk> of the postal service board of governors to accept $ N in <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 mr. <unk> was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $ N for his role in the scheme 
 in the agreement recognition agreed to pay the government $ N in return for the release of all claims against the company mr. moore and mr. <unk> 
 the five additional defendants were n't parties to the settlement 
 a trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began sept. N in federal court for the district of columbia 
 they were indicted last october on charges of fraud theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win $ N million in postal service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment 
 the company and its executives deny the charges 
 in a related development recognition equipment said the postal service has barred the company from bidding on postal contracts for an additional N days 
 the postal service originally suspended the company oct. N N and has been renewing the ban ever since 
 the company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension 
 intel corp. reported a N N drop in third-quarter net income partly because of a one-time charge for discontinued operations 
 the big semiconductor and computer maker said it had net of $ N million or N cents down N N from $ N million or N cents a share 
 the lower net included a charge of $ N million equal to N cents a share on an after-tax basis for the cost of abandoning a <unk> joint venture with siemens ag of west germany 
 earning also fell from the year-ago period because of slowing <unk> demand 
 sales amounted to $ N million down N N from $ N million 
 intel 's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading friday as investors appeared relieved that the company 's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter 's earnings of $ N million or N cents a share and that sales actually exceeded the $ N million for the second period 
 but intel later <unk> to the stock market 's plunge closing at $ N down $ N 
 in august intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be flat to down from the previous period 's because of slowing sales growth of its N microprocessor start-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company 's new N chip in the current quarter 
 on friday andrew <unk> intel president and chief executive officer said intel 's business is strong 
 for the nine-month period intel reported net of $ N million or $ N a share down N N from $ N million or $ N a share 
 revenue amounted to $ N billion up slightly from $ N billion 
 i 'm inspired by the mood of the people 
 things have gone too far for the government to stop them now 
 there 's no turning back 
 as other <unk> governments particularly poland and the soviet union have recently discovered initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult if not impossible to control 
 if it does the large number of <unk> whites who oppose any concessions to the black majority will step up their <unk> and threats to take matters into their own hands 
 the government is watching closely to see if their presence in the <unk> leads to increased <unk> protests and violence if it does pretoria will use this as a reason to keep mr. <unk> behind bars 
 pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life <unk> in the first place for sabotage and conspiracy to <unk> the government 
 the men also will be faced with <unk> the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many <unk> black <unk> the so-called young <unk> who are anxious to see the old <unk> in action 
 they never considered themselves to be anything else 
 at last night 's rally they called on their <unk> to be firm yet disciplined in their opposition to apartheid 
 we <unk> discipline because we know that the government is very very sensitive said andrew <unk> another early <unk> leader who is now N 
 we want to see nelson <unk> and all our <unk> out of prison and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us
