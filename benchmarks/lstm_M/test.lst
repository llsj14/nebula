 but while the new york stock exchange did n't fall apart friday as the dow jones industrial average plunged N points most of it in the final hour it barely managed to stay this side of chaos 
 some circuit breakers installed after the october N crash failed their first test traders say unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures

 at the end of the day N million shares were traded 
 the dow jones industrials closed at N 
 the dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the <unk> black monday crash that occurred oct. N N 
 the dow fell N N on black monday 
 on the exchange floor as soon as ual stopped trading we <unk> for a panic said one top floor trader 
 and N minutes after the ual trading halt came news that the ual group could n't get financing for its bid 
 at this point the dow was down about N points 
 the market <unk> 
 these stocks eventually reopened 
 traders said most of their major institutional investors on the other hand sat tight 
 under an agreement signed by the big board and the chicago mercantile exchange trading was temporarily halted in chicago 
 as a result the link between the futures and stock markets <unk> apart 
 without the <unk> of stock-index futures the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the big board 
 the futures halt was even <unk> by big board floor traders 
 it <unk> things up said one major specialist 
 in a stock-index arbitrage sell program traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference 
 when the airline information came through it <unk> every model we had for the marketplace said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms

 but stocks kept falling 
 the dow industrials were down N points at N p.m. before the <unk> halt 
 meanwhile during the the s&p trading halt s&p futures sell orders began <unk> up while stocks in new york kept falling sharply 
 big board chairman john j. phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker worked well <unk> 
 i just think it 's <unk> at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things 
 he <unk> out at a high-tech <unk> center on the floor of the big board where he could watch <unk> on prices and pending stock orders 
 buyers stepped in to the futures pit 
 at about N the s&p market <unk> to still another limit of N points down and trading was locked again

 at merrill lynch & co. the nation 's biggest brokerage firm a news release was prepared <unk> merrill lynch comments on market drop 
 the release cautioned that there are significant differences between the current environment and that of october N and that there are still attractive investment opportunities in the stock market 
 however jeffrey b. lane president of shearson lehman hutton inc. said that friday 's plunge is going to set back relations with customers because it <unk> the concern of volatility 
 and i think a lot of people will <unk> on program trading 
 it 's going to bring the debate right back to the <unk> 
 as the dow average ground to its final N loss friday the s&p pit stayed locked at its <unk> trading limit 
 jeffrey <unk> of program trader <unk> investment group said N s&p contracts were for sale on the close the equivalent of $ N million in stock 
 but there were no buyers 
 stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself 
 at those levels stocks are set up to be <unk> by index arbitragers who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall and simultaneously sell off stocks 
 but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today 
 the big board 's mr. <unk> said our <unk> performance was good 
 but the exchange will look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks 
 obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the <unk> obligations were n't met he said 
 but specialists complain privately that just as in the N crash the <unk> firms big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock stayed on the sidelines during friday 's <unk> 
 mr. phelan said it will take another day or two to analyze who was buying and selling friday

 george <unk> 
 ports of call inc. reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that were n't disclosed 
 the agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring 
 the company said a portion of the $ N million realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended <unk> operations 
 earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of boeing co. <unk> because of increasing maintenance costs 
 the $ N million bid includes the assumption of an estimated $ N million in secured liabilities on those properties according to those making the bid 
 we want to build and hold 
 these are n't mature assets but they have the potential to be so said mr. <unk> 
 managed properly and with a long-term outlook these can become investment-grade quality properties

 they will be available in minimum denominations of $ N 
 unlike the weekend before black monday the funds were n't <unk> with heavy withdrawal requests 
 and many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week 
 the boston firm said <unk> redemptions were running at less than one-third the level two years ago 
 as of yesterday afternoon the redemptions represented less than N N of the total cash position of about $ N billion of fidelity 's stock funds 
 this feels more like a <unk> deal 
 people are n't <unk> 
 the test may come today 
 friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act 
 some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices 
 stock fund redemptions during the N debacle did n't begin to <unk> until after the market opened on black monday 
 but fund managers say they 're ready 
 mario <unk> for instance holds cash positions well above N N in several of his funds 
 even peter lynch manager of fidelity 's $ N billion <unk> fund the nation 's largest stock fund built up cash to N N or $ N million 
 not all funds have raised cash levels of course 
 as a group stock funds held N N of assets in cash as of august the latest figures available from the investment company institute 
 that was modestly higher than the N N and N N levels in august and september of N 
 also persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash 
 a major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since black monday 
 <unk> sales have rebounded in recent months but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half N levels 
 many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy 
 fidelity 's mr. lynch for his part snapped up southern co. shares friday after the stock got <unk> 
 major mutual-fund groups said phone calls were <unk> at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday 
 but most investors were seeking share prices and other information 
 trading volume was only modestly higher than normal 
 they hope to avoid the <unk> phone lines and other <unk> that <unk> some fund investors in october N 
 fidelity on saturday opened its N <unk> investor centers across the country 
 the centers normally are closed through the weekend 
 t. rowe price associates inc. increased its staff of phone representatives to handle investor requests 
 the <unk> group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money-market funds 
 but most investors seemed to be in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode said steven <unk> a vice president 
 some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits 
 <unk> <unk> who runs shearson lehman hutton inc. 's $ N million sector analysis portfolio predicts the market will open down at least N points on technical factors and some panic selling 
 but she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than N N to N N from recent highs 
 this is not a major crash she said 
 nevertheless ms. <unk> said she was <unk> with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders 
 half of them are really scared and want to sell she said but i 'm trying to talk them out of it 
 the backdrop to friday 's slide was <unk> different from that of the october N crash fund managers argue 
 two years ago unlike today the dollar was weak interest rates were rising and the market was very <unk> they say 
 this time i do n't think we 'll get a panic reaction 
 newport corp. said it expects to report <unk> earnings of between N cents and N cents a share somewhat below analysts ' estimates of N cents to N cents 
 the maker of scientific instruments and laser parts said orders fell below expectations in recent months

 <unk> from the strike by N machinists union members against boeing co. reached air carriers friday as america west airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the seattle jet maker 
 mr. <unk> said boeing told america west that the N it was supposed to get this thursday would n't be delivered until nov. N the day after the airline had been planning to <unk> service at houston with four daily flights including three <unk> to phoenix and one <unk> to las vegas 
 now those routes are n't expected to begin until jan 
 boeing is also supposed to send to america west another N <unk> aircraft as well as a N by year 's end 
 those too are almost certain to arrive late 
 nevertheless the company 's reaction <unk> the <unk> effect that a huge manufacturer such as boeing can have on other parts of the economy 
 it also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company 
 i just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged <unk> tom baker president of machinists ' district N said in an interview yesterday 
 i do n't think their customers would like it very much 
 indeed a random check friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations 
 a spokesman for amr corp. said boeing has assured american airlines it will deliver a N on time later this month 
 as of friday four had been delivered and a fifth plane a N was supposed to be <unk> out over the weekend to air china 
 no date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table 
 the investment community for one has been anticipating a <unk> resolution 
 though boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market friday it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders 
 the market has taken two views that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very <unk> for boeing in the long term said howard <unk> an analyst at <unk> j. lawrence inc 
 boeing 's shares fell $ N friday to close at $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 still he said it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer 
 i would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything 
 last week boeing chairman frank <unk> sent striking workers a letter saying that to my knowledge boeing 's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major u.s. industrial firm in recent history 
 but mr. baker called the letter and the company 's offer of a N N wage increase over the life of the pact plus bonuses very weak 
 he added that the company <unk> the union 's resolve and the workers ' <unk> with being forced to work many hours overtime 
 the union is continuing to work through its expired contract however 
 it had planned a strike vote for next sunday but that has been pushed back indefinitely 
 the accord expired yesterday

 the eight major domestic auto makers sold N north <unk> cars in the first N days of october a N N drop from a year earlier 
 domestically built truck sales were down N N to N <unk> vans and sport utility vehicles 
 this appears particularly true at gm which had strong sales in august and september but saw its early october car and truck results fall N N from last year 's unusually high level 
 overall sales of all <unk> vehicles fell N N from a year ago 
 without gm overall sales for the other u.s. <unk> were roughly flat with N results

 in fact radio free europe is in danger of suffering from its success

 why does the <unk> virus keep coming back 
 perhaps it is because <unk> <unk> <unk> both military experience and the social <unk> 
 if only we could get america 's <unk> youth into at least a <unk> uniform we might be able to teach <unk> again and revive the spirit of giving 
 but the virus was kept alive in <unk> departments until a couple of years ago when it again was let loose 
 this time it attempted to <unk> two connected problems the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans 
 why not keep and even expand the loans and grants the advocates <unk> but require some form of service from each <unk>

 is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance 
 even if government does see various <unk> needs national service is not the way to meet them 
 if we want to support students we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more <unk> based on something called <unk> rather than on the government 's idea of service 
 or we might provide a tax credit for working students 
 what we do not need to do is start a war and then try to justify it by creating a <unk> bill 
 to the extent we lack manpower to staff <unk> jobs in hospitals for example we should raise pay pursue <unk> technology or allow more legal <unk> rather than <unk> high school graduates as short-term workers and cause <unk> among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs 
 will national service in the current highly <unk> and <unk> form <unk> enough appeal to get adopted 
 not necessarily 
 polls show wide <unk> support for some vague concept of service but the bill now under discussion lacks any <unk> public backing

 the debate over national service has begun again 
 at least N bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in congress this spring 
 it might well win senate passage 
 what is one to think of all this 
 people eager to have youth pay their <unk> to society favor service proposals <unk> mandatory ones 
 so do those who seek a <unk> concept of <unk> a concept imposing stern obligations as well as <unk> rights 
 to <unk> mandatory service is an <unk> and voluntary systems are <unk> uses of tax money 
 <unk> of the market question the value of the work national service would perform 
 if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth its cost 
 but what about those of us whose views are not <unk> by formula or <unk> 
 how should we think about national service 
 would service be voluntary or <unk> 
 short or long 
 <unk> or full-time 
 would participants live at home and work nearby or live in <unk> and work on public <unk> 
 what kinds of work would they do 
 what does national mean 
 would the program be run by the federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations 
 and who would serve 
 many or few 
 those are not <unk> questions and the label national service answers none of them 
 then how should we think about national service 
 as a starting point here are five <unk> N consider the <unk> not the name 
 they will differ in crucial ways 
 N service should be service 
 it follows that proposals like <unk> whose benefits to <unk> are worth some $ N a year do not qualify 
 but the earnings exceed by N N the average income of young high school graduates with full-time jobs 
 why call that service 
 <unk> service is unconstitutional 
 it is also <unk> and <unk> 
 who will throw several hundred thousand <unk> in jail each year 
 but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior 
 they involve <unk> to participants 
 <unk> programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some $ N a year 
 are they worth that 
 <unk> suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are counted 
 but the calculations are <unk> 
 N <unk> youth are a special concern 
 are such expenditures <unk> then 
 yes if targeted 
 they can volunteer at any of thousands of <unk> institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers 
 <unk> youth do n't have those opportunities 
 they are not <unk> in high school or college 
 they are unlikely to be employed 
 but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed 
 strictly speaking these youth are not performing service 
 but they believe themselves to be serving and they begin to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives to think of the future 
 that is a service to the nation

 the consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the ual takeover and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the ual trading halt 
 still the consensus seems almost as wide that one <unk> bid is no reason to write down the value of all u.s. business 
 this <unk> leads us to another piece of news moving on the dow jones <unk> shortly before the downturn the success of senate democrats in <unk> the capital gains tax cut 
 and market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the house last month 
 an hour before friday 's plunge that provision was stripped from the tax bill leaving it with $ N billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut 
 it would be a good thing if congress started to decide issues <unk> on their individual merits without <unk> 
 for one thing no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an <unk> vote 
 since senate leaders have so far <unk> it up with procedural <unk> promises of a cleaner bill are suspect 
 especially so since president bush has been weakened by the panama <unk> 
 to the extent that the ual troubles contributed to the plunge they are another instance of washington 's <unk> fingers 
 as the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course at some point the market will start to reject them 
 worse congress has started to jump on the skinner <unk> 
 james <unk> the minnesota democrat who chairs the public works and transportation committee 's aviation subcommittee has put an <unk> takeover bill on <unk> speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the american and united air lines bids 
 it would give mr. skinner up to N days to review any bid for N N or more of the voting stock of any u.s. carrier with revenues of $ N billion or more 
 so the ual deal has problems and the market loses N points 
 <unk> mr. secretary and mr. congressman 
 even more important in our view was the treasury 's threat to <unk> the dollar 
 the treasury is doing the same thing today <unk> the dollar is not under <unk> pressure

 they are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape <unk> and clearing and settlement delays 
 the fed promises any needed liquidity 
 the big board 's <unk> with the chicago board of trade has improved it will be interesting to learn if circuit breakers prove to be a good idea

 two former ministers were so heavily <unk> in the <unk> affair that <unk> members of parliament voted to refer them to the special court
